# Security Policy
Let us know as soon as possible when you discover a potential security problem and we will make every effort to resolve it promptly.

Give us a reasonable time to resolve the issue before disclosing it to the public or third parties. If appropriate, we may publicly disclose the issue before resolving it.

## Supported Versions
We usually do not apply patches to versions that are two numbers below the major version, but if it is a serious problem, there is always an exception.

We do our best to keep our users safe, but we expect them to use the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can reach us per email at security@kryptopass.org.

For less sensitive reports, you can also open an issue or pull request on GitHub.
